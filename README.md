# Nmap on VirtualBox Virtual Machine

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to install and use **Nmap** within a **VirtualBox virtual machine** for network scanning and security analysis.  
The goal is to simulate a safe penetration testing environment to learn and practice ethical hacking skills without affecting real-world networks.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **VirtualBox** (Oracle VM VirtualBox)
- **Linux OS** (Kali Linux used in this project, but other Linux distros also work)
- **Nmap** (Network Mapper)
- **Target VM** (Metasploitable2 used as vulnerable machine for scanning)

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

### 1. Install VirtualBox
- Download from: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Install according to your OS instructions.

### 2. Create Two Virtual Machines
- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux with Nmap pre-installed.
- **Target Machine**: Metasploitable2 (intentionally vulnerable).

### 3. Configure Network
- Use **Host-Only Adapter** or **Internal Network** to keep all traffic inside the lab environment.
- Verify both VMs are on the same subnet:
  ```bash
  ip addr
````

## 📖 How to Use Nmap in VirtualBox Lab

### 1. Check Nmap Installation

```bash
nmap --version
```

### 2. Basic Host Discovery

```bash
nmap 192.168.56.101
```

*Scans the target VM's IP address for open ports.*

### 3. Scan Multiple Hosts

```bash
nmap 192.168.56.1-255
```

### 4. Service & Version Detection

```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.56.101
```

### 5. Aggressive Scan

```bash
nmap -A 192.168.56.101
```

### 6. Save Scan Results

```bash
nmap -A 192.168.56.101 -oN results.txt
```

## 📊 Example Scan Output

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp   open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 4.7p1
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.2.8
...
```
